### Overview

This an expo of some of the code I wrote for a project in the Spring and Summer of 2024. 

It is a REST API built in python with fastapi. 

The API sits in between a database and a frontend built in typescript (insert link). The application on a whole is a full stack data application that allows stakeholders to understand and report on viewership data related to Spectrum News and it's competitors. 

This code comes from an old commit and only contains logic for about 1/3 of the features currently active in the app.
